# Free online board and card games
A list of a bunch of websites you can use to play board games and card games online with others for free, whether real-time or taking turns.

In using these services, if you don't want to provide your actual email address, use [a proxy address](https://anonaddy.com/) or [a temporary email address](https://10minutemail.com/). I would suggest using one of these so that you don't have to give your actual email address.

If you have any you would like added, make a pull request or start an issue!

For fellow programmers: a * at the end of the line means that the game/website is open-source.
